                                        Hello, everyone.<br>
                                        My name is Solaiman Hakkani, and I'm a IT Engineer.<br>
                                        I've been with the channel i company for five years now.<br>
                                        I started as a technician and over the years progressed to my current role.<br>
                                        When I'm not working, I like to spend time with my family.<br>
                                        I like to play guitar & spend my times with my laptop to learn something new.<br>
                                        Am from Gaibandha Zilla which located in Rangpur Division.<br>
                                        It's good to be here and to meet you all in person.<br>
                                        We all exchange emails and phone calls, but it's hard to know someone until you've met face to face.<br>
                                        I'm looking forward to talking about our upcoming project with all of you."
